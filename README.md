## Last time we discussed our certain and fully correct views on certain races and their rights or actually the lack there of 
## Today we are discussing something of sorts but regarding one certain race that I seemed to have overlooked in my past endavour
## They are the curry munchers or as more "respectfully" known Indians
## Now if you happen to be Indian and you are on this github you are punsihable by a Public decapitation while your family watches in horror and await their turns
## So, if your are Indian and you're on here I would say either hide for your life and pray to those idols that you call Gods but they will not save you from the eternal truth and the end of your story by my hands
## I will wash  my hands and clean the world of your flith and your unholy blood that will cover the end of my bayonnet
## In the eyes of the law and true justice that stand besides us and my fellow supporters Indian is not a race blatently that is the way to say it
## However,if we were to get into the nitty gritty I would say they are insects that deserve to be squised under our feet
## Purely because God created Humans then he created colours
## If he never truly wanted segregation why would there be different colours and different climates in different regions of the earth (that shall belong to this revolution)
## We the true owners of this earth have to face the harsh cold while these Indians climb on to trains and rush my cities to flush my cities with their filthy stink that is worse than a skunk that's been bred and released into this earth by God
## Yet these indians they somehow have rights? The audacity to actually breathe in the same air as us and pollute it for our future Generations
# HOWEVER,
## My fellow supporters, I shall not allow for this heinous race to survive and allow the future generations of us greats to suffer because we could not take the right steps at the right time
## I the Great Carcajados:
# Declare the Indian Hunting Season Open....
